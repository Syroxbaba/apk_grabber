Apk grabber
===========

Grabs apk files from devices based on a grep pattern, and extracts a jar file.  Uses grep, so it can work on more than one apk, if applicable.

Syntax:

`apk_grabber.py paypal`: grabs all apks that match *paypal* in the _package name_.
`apk_grabber.py *` grabs all apks on the device.
