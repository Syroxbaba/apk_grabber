Apk grabber
===========

Grabs apk files from devices based on python's regex pattern, and extracts a jar file.  More than one pattern may be provided on the command line, so that all apks that match any of the criteria are grabbed.

Syntax:

`apk_grabber.py paypal`: grabs all apks that match *paypal* in the _package name_.

`apk_grabber.py ''`: grabs all apks on the device.
